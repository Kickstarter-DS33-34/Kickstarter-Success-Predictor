# **Kickstart Success**
## Feburary 2022

## ☝️ *Pitch*

Using Neural Network classification techniques, Kickstarter Success can help predict how successful a kickstarter campaign will be based on the monetary goal, description, campaign length, or catagories.

## ✅  *MVP*

1.   The model is able to take in a User's Kickstarter information and descriptions to come up with that Kickstart's probability of success within it's time frame
2.   Deploy model on Heroku so that predictions can be displayed to the User
3.   A User would be able to see this probability and make adjustments to their campaign to increase their probability of success.
